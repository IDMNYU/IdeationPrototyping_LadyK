# Time Management Technique: [Actionable Tasks](ActionableTasks.md)

Actionable, in this sense, means that you are able to do it within one "sitting." Sitting is definable up to you. It could mean 30 minutes. It could mean 2 hours. The critical point, is that this task is doable in that time.

For example:

* Can you read a novel in one sitting?....Most likely, no. How might you break it down to be acheiveable across various sittings? Perhaps it's "read for 30 minutes." Perhaps it's "read ten pages." Regardless, it's critical to break tasks down into doable steps.

* Can you study for your Chemistry Exam in one sitting? ....Most likely, no. How might we break this down into digestible steps? Perhaps we review Chapters 1-3 in one sitting (say, a 2 hour increment sitting). Then Chapters 4-6 in another sitting. Then we review notes for a short sitting each study session.

* Can you make a cake in one sitting? Well, first you need a recipe. Then you need the supplies. Then you need time to bake the cake. Each of these can be done at different times. The important thing to realize that each needs an allotted time to be executed.

Break your tasks down into actionable (do-able in one sitting)/smaller digestible steps.
