## Group Exercise to Identify low, medium & high project risks

Within your group, introduce your project with a short elevator pitch. Present the current standing of your Moodboard while talking. Let your group members ask you questions regarding your project. Such as:

	- Have you thought about...?

	- Tell me more about.....?

	- Does this relate to.....?

	- Are you thinking about......?

After a short discussion, group members then write feedback on the post-it notes, for straw, sticks and stone, with reference to aspects of your project that are strong, weak, and inbetween. Underneath each rating, they will give you feedback & ideas.

<div align="center">

| **Made of Straw** (yellow) | **Made of Sticks** (green) | **Made of Stone** (blue) |
|:---------------------------:|:---------------------------:|:-------------------------:|
| **High Risk**               | **Medium Risk**             | **Low Risk**              |
| Weak or could fall apart.   | Somewhat rigid.             | Immovable. Low Risk.      |

</div>

## Afterwards, use this feedback to help your project onto more solid grounds. Create How Might We statements to identify next steps. Post these statements and a general reflection regarding the feedback process on your site, under "Reflections"
