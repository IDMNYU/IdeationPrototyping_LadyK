### DM-UY 1143 Ideation and Prototyping


# [Artifact 1: Tool](Artifact_Tool.md)

Design a new or undiscovered tool with reference to your Future Research Project.

Use prototyping to futher your idea and making.

- Use the [Crazy Eight Exercise](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVI-siAKA=/?share_link_id=441850070749) to help you think of options. Continue with a mindmap to develop

- Sketch your idea out, in many forms and perspectives

- Create a low-fi 3D model. Think: simple supplies: stuff around the house/recycling bin + hot glue gun + exacto knife, string, cardboard, legos, tissues, paper, tape

- Create a higher-fi model

Through each of these stages, document your PROCESS. Reflect on how it went. What did you learn and/or discover? What has changed? What difficulties did you encounter?
