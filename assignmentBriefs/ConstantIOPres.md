### DM-UY 1143 Ideation and Prototyping

# [Constant Input/Output Presentation](ConstantIOPres.md)

#### Presentations will take place during class time on November 24th.

Prepare a short (5 minutes or less) presentation of what transpired with your Constant Input Output project. This is not talking about why you did what you did, or why you choose this thing. It is to talk about high and low points of the process of executing the project - the good, the bad, the ugly. And we've all had ugly. It's part of any process.

Start by giving an elevator synopsis of your project concept. Then talk about how it went, including deviations, twists, and barren valleys. Do not sugar coat it. Do not take us through every blessed week.

Format:

You may choose! It can be slides, it can be images, it can be sounds, it can be a video of you giving the presentation, or a video of the content, it can be browser tabs with particular posts you wish to highlight.

Practice it. You will only have 5 minutes to give this presentation. Use it wisely.
