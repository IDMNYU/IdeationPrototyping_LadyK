# Constant Input or Constant Output project - Week 2: Going Deeper

It's important to go deeper to explore your ideas for your Constant Input/Output project. 

The goal of this assignment is 

* to become more solid on what you want to do
* understand your desire + passion
* understand your fears
* understand where you might fail
* understand how to combat your failures
* what your next steps are
* what resources you need

## Write a paragraph or more reflection responding to each of these questions. 

0. Do (another) round of mind mapping, if you've been directed, if you need to, or you would like to. _Inevitiably_ a second round brings more about and strengthens your process. Post pictures and a short refection to your site.

If you've changed your mind, do another round of mind mapping and post images to your site. Write a short reflection about this process and where you are at. what questions do you have?

1. Once you have a solid direction/idea or several ideas, ask yourself [the 5 Why's for each idea](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVLk2bckY=/?share_link_id=284492509093). Reference the Miro board to do this exercise properly. Each Why is asked about the answer to the previous why. This is to help you get to the root of your desires/passion. 

2. Identify the problems or various aspects that need to be resolved, in order to start OR to do your project. Is there a goal? How might YOU get to that goal? Use the question How Might We....? To explore this topic more. Think: DIVERGENT THINKING. Create another mind map or list. Check the Miro Board - [How Might We](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVI8y4ILA=/?share_link_id=437453676825) - to see an example. 

3. What is motivating you about this?

4. What are your assumptions about this? Tell us about them and list them. Go deep. Not cursory
