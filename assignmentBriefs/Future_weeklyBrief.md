# [Future Project](Future.md) Weekly Brief

### Semester Week 9 | Week 1: Future Project - Launch

1. Read Speculative Everything (see Slack for the link) Chapter 1. This chapter will situate the project, giving it context, as you are developing a speculative future. Do not skip it. Write a brief reflection and post under reflections (if you have not done so).


2. Design your UMD research endeavor. Post it under 'Future Research' with a reflection of why you picked it, how you hope it informs you, and how you went about it.

3. Do a mind map describing and exploring the elements and components in your world, along with your topic. What do you what to be going on in this world? What are the wonderful things? What are the conflicts?

4. Write a short summary from this mindmap, expressing details of this world. Gather a few images for a new moodboard for this world

5. Gather a resource or two which support these other elements and components in your world. Annotate them.
