# [Future Project](../Future.md) Weekly Brief

### Semester Week 11 | Week 3: Future Project

1. Write a short reflection discussing the developments, points that you are at, questions that you have, and things you intend to develop further. What do you need to research? What are you weak points?

2. Post exercises done in class, as well as a reflection. Did you gain anything from each of them?

3. Work on the next stage of your artifact

4. Develop your Future Project further. Research, Concept Map, Timeline (continuation), Stakeholders, Mindmaps. 5WH (who, what, when, where, why, how), UMD #2 ideas/sketches, moodboards, project statements, etc. Move your project forward. How are you developing and strengthening it? What are you researching?

### Semester Week 10 | Week 2: Future Project

1. Write a short reflection discussing the developments, points that you are at, questions that you have, and things you intend to develop further. What do you need to research? What are you weak points?

2. Think of what you'd want this world to be like with reference to your Future Research Topic. Or, maybe think and create the world you do not like. Perhaps it's your worst idea. Super! How can all of your previous research inform what might need to happen? Or, thinking about the world you want, use Sticky Steps (See [Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVLOv4iHs=/?share_link_id=990800284556) to work backwards to see what you need to create to have these things happen.

3. Post your Ethics exercise work and write a reflection. How does this impact your perspective of the Future Project?

4. Post your Speculative Design reflection. How does this impact your perspective of the Future Project?

5. Work on moving your artifact and it's iterations FORWARD. Document the process and post about it.

6. Address and do what needs to be done to bring your work up to speed and/or to move your project forward. Use a previous exercise to help you along. Post and reflect throughout the process.


### Semester Week 9 | Week 1: Future Project - Launch

1. Read Speculative Everything (see Slack for the link) Chapter 1. This chapter will situate the project, giving it context, as you are developing a speculative future. Do not skip it. Write a brief reflection and post under reflections (if you have not done so).


2. Design your UMD research endeavor. Post it under 'Future Research' with a reflection of why you picked it, how you hope it informs you, and how you went about it.

3. Do a mind map describing and exploring the elements and components in your world, along with your topic. What do you what to be going on in this world? What are the wonderful things? What are the conflicts?

4. Write a short summary from this mindmap, expressing details of this world. Gather a few images for a new moodboard for this world

5. Gather a resource or two which support these other elements and components in your world. Annotate them.
