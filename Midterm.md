### DM-UY 1143 Ideation and Prototyping

# Future Project Research

20% of your final grade

[2.5% (separate) of your final grade Artifact: Tool Prototype & Development](assignmentBriefs/Artifact_Tool.md)



### Due Week 7 to your Process site:

Your current standing of the following:
- Concept Map
- Annotated Bibliography
- Problem statement(s)
- Timeline
- Moodboard
- UMD work
- Mindmaps

Choose a problem or an issue from the list below, or one you've come across and 1). investigate the issue more and 2) ideate on possibilities

You must show evidence of your divergent and convergent thinking process.

1) First you must understand the problem in order to define a core area/goal. You must gather data and information in order to examine the situation. Then you are to formulate your challenge.

2) Then you are to ideate to generate possibilities, given that research. This is where I'm looking for your to stretch your imagination and to seek novelty.

You are to show evidence of your entire process. Remember the principles of Creativity:

	1) Defer Judgement
	2) Go for Quanity (Extended Effort Principle) Show Lateral Thinking
	3) Make Connections (PO, Remix)
	4) Seek Novelty - Dream big and go far.

Use Divergent and Convergent thinking tools in each step! Show evidence of your process through documentation of exercises, images and reflections. Remember, I'm looking at the depth of your process; not simply where you end up.


## Possible Example Topics:

- MicroPlastics

- The loss/endangerment of a creature

- CrowdStrike Software Update Error

- Loneliness/Changing Social Interactions

- The cost/issues with food production

### Research Techniques

I am looking for you to broaden your research techniques to throw your nets wide! Think: science publications, movies, interviews with with professionals and those involved, site visits, etc. 

Use 3 techniques from The Pocket Universal Methods of Design _in addition to_ traditional rsearch methods (Journal Articles, Reputable News, Books, THE LIBRARY). Show how you have used these techniques and what they've brought into your project



#### The items and exercises below should be evident on your site, prior to completeing the above requested documents. These exercises and assignments help to develop the documents.
